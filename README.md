System-specific notes
---------------------
The data were generated by Matlab R2016a or higher versions, and the codes of various networks were tested in Tensorflow 1.14 version in Python 3.7 on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------
This toolbox consists of two self-supervised unmixing network architectures, i.e., pixel-wise EGU-Net using fully-connected networks (EGU-Net-pw), spatial-spectral EGU-Net using convolutional neural networks (EGU-Net-ss). For more details, please refer to the paper.

The used data (named TNNLS_Data) for the network input, including the orginal hyperspectral image, the extracted endmembers (spectral bundles) and the corresponding pseudo abundances, can be downloaded from
